# Chess Game

This project is a simple implementation of a chess game in TypeScript and Svelte.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-game.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd chess-game`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

To run the game, use the following command: `npm run dev`

The game will be launched in the browser. http://localhost:5174.

For testing purposes you can use the following url to view the board an 'play around': http://localhost:5174/game/[something]

## Implementation

The game is implemented using TypeScript and follows the principles of object-oriented programming. The main components of the game are:

- `Board`: Represents the chessboard and manages the positions of the pieces.
- `Piece`: Represents a chess piece and provides methods for calculating valid moves.
- `Square`: Represents a square on the chessboard and holds a reference to the piece on that square.
- `Game`: Handles the game logic and provides the main entry point for running the game.
